# Final Steps for Construction System Migration

## Issue Fixed

The error `Unknown module 'constructionManager'` has been fixed by removing the reference to the old constructionManager module in the construction.js file.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the fix-construction script** to add placeholder implementations for missing methods:
   ```javascript
   require('fix-construction')
   ```

2. **Implement the missing methods** in the construction.js file. The fix-construction script will tell you which methods need to be implemented.

3. **Test the system** to make sure everything is working correctly:
   ```javascript
   require('verify-construction')()
   ```

4. **Delete temporary files** when you're done:
   - main.js.updated
   - migration-construction.js
   - cleanup-construction.js
   - verify-construction.js
   - delete-old-files.js
   - fix-construction.js
   - MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md
   - FINAL-STEPS.md

## Implementation Strategy

For each missing method, you'll need to copy the implementation from the old constructionManager.js file. Here's a general approach:

1. Look at the error messages to identify which methods are missing
2. Find the implementation of each method in the old constructionManager.js file
3. Copy the implementation to the construction.js file
4. Test each method to make sure it works correctly

## Common Methods to Implement

The most commonly needed methods are:

- `planRoads` - Plans road placement in a room
- `planContainers` - Plans container placement near sources
- `planExtensions` - Plans extension placement in a room
- `generateRoomPlan` - Generates a complete room plan
- `createConstructionSites` - Creates construction sites based on plans

## Conclusion

Once you've implemented all the missing methods, your construction system will be fully migrated to the new consolidated structure.
