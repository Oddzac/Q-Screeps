# Construction System Refactoring

## Overview

The construction system has been refactored to consolidate multiple files into a more efficient and maintainable structure. This refactoring reduces code duplication, improves CPU efficiency, and makes the system easier to understand and extend.

## Files Created

1. `construction.js` - Main consolidated construction module
2. `global.construction.js` - Global interface functions
3. `helpers.js` - Helper functions for the construction system
4. `construction-refactor.md` - Detailed documentation
5. `migration-construction.js` - Migration script
6. `main.js.updated` - Updated main.js file

## Files to Replace

1. `constructionManager.js`
2. `constructionManager.planLinks.js`
3. `constructionOptimizer.js`
4. `global.analyzeRoomPlanAlignment.js`
5. `global.checkNextConstructionSites.js`
6. `global.checkPlanningStatus.js`
7. `global.diagnosisConstruction.js`

## Migration Steps

1. Review the new files to ensure they meet your requirements
2. Run the migration script to verify compatibility: `require('migration-construction')()`
3. Replace `main.js` with `main.js.updated` or manually update it
4. Test the system in a simulation room
5. Once verified, delete the old files

## Benefits

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functions are now shared
- **Improved CPU Efficiency**: Consolidated caching and optimized function calls
- **Better Maintainability**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Fewer imports and clearer module relationships
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error reporting

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// In main.js
const construction = require('construction');
construction.run(room);

// In console
global.checkPlanningStatus('W1N1');
global.diagnosisConstruction('W1N1');
global.generateRoomPlan('W1N1');
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during migration:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify that all new files are properly created
3. Make sure main.js is correctly updated
4. Try running the migration script again
5. If problems persist, revert to the old files and try again

## Future Improvements

- Further optimize memory usage by compressing position data
- Implement more advanced room planning algorithms
- Add support for defensive structures (ramparts, walls)
- Improve visualization with more detailed structure information
