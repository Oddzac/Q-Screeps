# Construction System Refactoring

## Overview

The construction system has been refactored to consolidate multiple files into a more efficient and maintainable structure. This refactoring reduces code duplication, improves CPU efficiency, and makes the system easier to understand and extend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Files

The following files have been consolidated into a single `construction.js` module:

- `constructionManager.js` - Main construction management logic
- `constructionManager.planLinks.js` - Link planning functionality
- `constructionOptimizer.js` - Construction optimization utilities
- `global.analyzeRoomPlanAlignment.js` - Room plan alignment analysis
- `global.checkNextConstructionSites.js` - Construction site checking
- `global.checkPlanningStatus.js` - Planning status reporting
- `global.diagnosisConstruction.js` - Construction diagnostics

### 2. New Module Structure

- **construction.js** - Main module containing all construction functionality
  - Core construction management functions
  - Structure planning functions (roads, containers, extensions, etc.)
  - Room plan analysis and visualization
  - Construction site management
  - Integrated optimizer as a sub-module

- **global.construction.js** - Global interface for construction functions
  - Provides user-friendly global functions for console access
  - Handles input validation and formatting of outputs
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing global functions

### 3. Benefits

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functions are now shared across the system
- **Improved CPU Efficiency**: Consolidated caching and optimized function calls
- **Better Maintainability**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Fewer imports and clearer module relationships
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error reporting

## Usage

The refactored system maintains backward compatibility with existing code. All global functions continue to work as before:

```javascript
// Generate a room plan
global.generateRoomPlan('W1N1');

// Check construction status
global.checkPlanningStatus('W1N1');

// Diagnose construction issues
global.diagnosisConstruction('W1N1');

// Analyze room plan alignment
global.analyzeRoomPlanAlignment('W1N1');

// Force construction site creation
global.forceConstruction('W1N1', 3);
```

## Implementation Notes

To use the new system in your code, simply require the construction module:

```javascript
const construction = require('construction');

// Run construction manager for a room
construction.run(room);

// Plan specific structures
construction.planRoads(room);
construction.planExtensions(room);
construction.planTowers(room);
construction.planLinks(room);

// Access optimizer functions
const structures = construction.optimizer.getCachedStructuresByType(room);
```

## Future Improvements

- Further optimize memory usage by compressing position data
- Implement more advanced room planning algorithms
- Add support for defensive structures (ramparts, walls)
- Improve visualization with more detailed structure information
- Add priority-based construction site creation
